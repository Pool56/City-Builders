## Project summary
This project proposes an AI-Driven Urban Renewal Platform that leverages IBM Watsonx.ai, IBM Cognos Analytics, and AutoCAD to transform unsafe mud-built slums into sustainable, concrete-based formal settlements. The solution combines predictive analytics, generative AI, and engineering design to create safe housing, optimize resources, and provide transparent monitoring aligned with UN SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).

### The issue we are hoping to solve
Informal settlements in many urban centers:
Are built from mud and non-durable materials, leaving residents vulnerable to floods, fires, and building collapse.
Lack basic infrastructure such as sanitation, drainage, and reliable energy.
Suffer from overcrowding, unplanned growth, and poor governance in resource allocation.
Are rarely integrated into official urban planning systems, making them invisible in long-term development agendas.
The challenge is to transition slums into resilient, affordable, and inclusive formal housing without mass displacement and with measurable sustainability outcomes.

### How our technology solution can help
Our solution integrates AI, engineering design, and analytics to deliver evidence-based, transparent, and scalable housing transformation:
Watsonx.ai

Analyzes satellite images, census data, and IoT inputs to identify slum boundaries, density, and growth patterns.
Predicts population migration trends and calculates future material demand.
Uses generative AI to produce multiple redevelopment layouts (low-rise, modular, mixed-use).

AutoCAD

Translates AI-optimized layouts into detailed engineering blueprints and BIM-ready models.
Ensures compliance with local building codes, seismic safety, and environmental constraints.
Produces 3D visualizations to engage communities and support participatory decision-making.

IBM Cognos Analytics

Monitors budget expenditure, funding source accountability, and project KPIs (time, cost, quality).
Tracks material usage vs. AI predictions to detect inefficiencies early.
Reports on environmental indicators (CO₂ reduction, % green space maintained, renewable energy adoption).
Provides dashboards for government, NGOs, and the public, ensuring transparency and trust.


### Our idea
   We envision a closed-loop urban redevelopment pipeline where data, design, and decision-making flow seamlessly:

Data-driven Planning: Watsonx.ai identifies high-priority slum zones, forecasts future growth, and simulates housing layouts.
Engineering Design: AutoCAD imports these layouts to create construction-ready plans with integrated roads, drainage, and utilities.
Transparent Monitoring: Cognos Analytics provides real-time dashboards to track resources, progress, and sustainability outcomes.
Community Engagement: AI-generated “before/after” 3D models and Cognos transparency portals foster trust and acceptance.





## Technology implementation

### IBM watsonx product(s) used

Predicted material demand (3,500 tons concrete/month, 750 tons steel/month).
AI-generated redevelopment scenarios (low-rise apartments: 18,000 units, modular housing: 22,000 units).


### Other IBM technology used

IBM Cognos Analytics – Monitoring, reporting and transparency

Material usage versus AI predictions - Concrete predicted 3,500 tons, actual 3,650 tons → +4.3% variance.

### Project development roadmap
Phase 1 - Data collection and preparation lasting for one to three months

IBM software Used:

IBM Maximo Application Suite - Deploy IoT sensors and asset monitoring for existing infrastructure (water pipes, drainage, electricity).

IBM Cloud Pak for Data - Integrate data sources (satellite imagery, census data, IoT streams) into a unified data lake.

Watson Discovery → Process government reports, policy documents, and legal records to extract constraints and regulations.

Key activities:

Map current slum boundaries using drone and  satellite images.

Digitize household data, land ownership records and growth trends.

Baseline survey on infrastructure status.




Phase 2 - Predictive analytics and planning lasting from four to six months 

IBM software used:

Watsonx.ai -  Train AI models to predict migration, housing demand, and material needs.

IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite -  Model flood risks, heat islands, and climate impacts on new housing.

IBM SPSS Modeler -  Statistical forecasting of population and economic patterns.

Key activities:

Generate AI-driven scenarios for low-rise, modular, and mixed-use housing.

Create GIS redevelopment maps with risk overlays.

Forecast material requirements (concrete, steel, sanitation systems).


## Additional details

Unfortunately, i was unsuccessful on exporting the zip file from Watsonx.ai.
In the GitHub section i have placed the python code, moreover i was unsuccessful on using the account given during the hackathon i was informed that i needed to upgrade my account as the trial expired.

### Judging criteria

Completeness and feasibility

Feasibility:
The solution integrates three proven IBM and industry technologies — Watsonx.ai, AutoCAD, and IBM Cognos Analytics — all of which are already commercially available and interoperable via APIs or data exports.

Watsonx.ai: Feasible for urban planning prediction models due to existing AI capabilities in geospatial analysis and generative design.

AutoCAD: Industry-standard for translating AI-generated layouts into construction-ready blueprints.

IBM Cognos Analytics: Feasible for real-time KPI tracking and public transparency.

Planning:
The workflow from data collection → AI modeling → engineering design → progress monitoring → public engagement is fully mapped and addresses technical, social, and governance aspects.

Proof-of-concept readiness:
Clear roles for each technology and tangible deliverables (dashboards, 3D designs, risk maps). The application of IBM technology is explicit and central to the process.




Creativity and Innovation

Unique application of AI:
Using Watsonx.ai for predictive settlement growth modeling, AI-optimized concrete mix design, and generative urban layout planning is a novel integration that goes beyond standard slum redevelopment approaches.

Differentiation:
Most current urban renewal projects are manual, top-down engineering exercises; this solution adds a data-driven, AI-guided, community-inclusive layer.

Market positioning:
Combines civil engineering software (AutoCAD) with IBM’s AI + analytics ecosystem in a single, scalable redevelopment pipeline — not commonly found in existing municipal housing programs.


Design and Usability
Design Strengths:

The Watsonx.ai interface can be pre-trained to allow municipal staff to run “what-if” scenarios without deep AI expertise.

AutoCAD’s parametric models can adapt quickly to changes in funding, land, or population density.

Cognos dashboards have user-friendly drill-downs for NGOs, donors, and the public.

Ease of Adoption:
Local government engineers and planners can integrate into their existing CAD and reporting workflows.

Minor Considerations:
Some slum areas may have incomplete or outdated data, requiring a baseline data collection phase before AI processing — slightly slowing immediate deployment in the first project.



Effectiveness and Efficiency 

Relevance:
Directly addresses UN SDG 11 priorities: safe housing, sustainable urbanization, and resilience.

Effectiveness:

Predictive modeling prevents misallocation of resources and ensures phased redevelopment without mass displacement.

Cognos monitoring reduces corruption and keeps stakeholders accountable.

AutoCAD designs ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations.

Efficiency:
AI-driven planning cuts down manual planning cycles from months to weeks.

Scalability:
The same pipeline can be adapted for other cities, disaster-recovery housing, or rural-to-urban transition planning.
